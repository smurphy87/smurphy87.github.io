	<h1>1983-84 Edmonton Oilers</h1>
	<p>Due to the salary cap, we will never  again see a team as stacked as the 1983-84 Oilers who featured stars including Wayne Gretzky, Paul Coffey, Mark Messier and Jari Kurri. They cruised through the regular season with an impressive 57-18-5 record and set the NHL record for most goals per game, averaging over five. Gretzky led the team by scoring 87 goals and recording a total of 205 points. The Oilers went on to defeat the defending champions, The New York Islanders, in five games to become the new champions. </p>
