	<h1>1991-92 Pittsburgh Penguins</h1>
	<p>With offensive powerhouses like Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jarg, and Brian Trottier, the penguins were a shear force. Their defence lacked slightly as they lost the legendary Paul Coffey in a February trade. They did however have Ulf Samuelsson holding up the blue line along with unbelievable netminding from Tom Barrasso in between the pipes. They took it all the way to the cup final and won it all for the second straight year, defeating the Chicago Blackhawks. </p>
